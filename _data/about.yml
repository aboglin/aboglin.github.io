    summary: |
      My research develops technology-driven methods to objectively assess behavior and suitablity, using sensors and computer vision to improve welfare, efficiency, and selection processes across species.
    details: |
      My work has integrated biobehavioral analysis and engineering to objectively identify job suitability in working dogs, which leverages sensor-equipped toys to quantify interaction patterns. By measuring behaviors such as bite duration and frequency, this approach uncovers data-driven indicators of temperament and aptitude that improve selection processes for service roles. Such methodologies move beyond subjective assessment, bridging animal needs and technological solutions to support more efficient, ethical, and transparent working dog placement. In parallel, I employ computer vision to monitor swine behaviors before, during, and after the use of ingestible devices, quantifying behavioral changes to rigorously assess device impact, such as satiety modulation from vibrating capsulesâ€”bridging animal needs and technological solutions across species.

      I engineer ingestible and implantable devices for probing the gut-brain axis, integrating miniaturized sensors, stimulators, and wireless communication modules into biocompatible platforms.
    summary: |
      I engineer ingestible and implantable devices for probing the gut-brain axis. This work requires integrating miniaturized sensors, stimulators, and wireless communication modules into biocompatible platforms that can withstand the harsh gastrointestinal environment.
    details: |
      My work has incorporated multimodal sensing, such as motility or physiological signals. It has focused on delivering targeted neuromodulation through electrical or mechanostimulatory actuation to modulate enteric neural activity. Implantable systems, particularly those interfacing with the enteric nervous system, must achieve stable, low-noise signal acquisition while minimizing tissue irritation and ensuring long-term reliability. Coupling these peripheral devices with electrophysiological monitoring of brain signals, such as cortical or vagal recordings, enables bidirectional feedback loops that capture correlations between gut events and central neural responses. Advanced computational pipelines, including real-time signal processing, feature extraction, and closed-loop control algorithms, allow these systems to dynamically adjust stimulation parameters based on detected neural or behavioral states. Together, this convergence of biomedical engineering and neurogastroenterology provides a pathway to mechanistically decode gut-brain communication and design targeted interventions for disorders like irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, and functional dyspepsia.
