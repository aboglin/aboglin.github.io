  <span class="highlight" style="font-size:2.5em; font-weight:bold;">
    I engineer intelligent interfaces that decode latent states and behaviors, creating adaptive models that respond in real time to proactively deliver actionable insights for care, automate monitoring, and optimize decision-making workflows across clinical, research, and caregiving contexts.

fields:
  aci:
    heading: Animal-Computer Interaction
    description: |
      I take a multi-pronged approach to data for ACI. Leveraging interviews with handlers, observation of handler/canine interactions and relationships, and by quantifying the canine interactions with their world, we can start to get a better understanding of how to design technology for animals.

  ingestible:
    heading: Biobehavioral Ingestibles
    description: |
      I have experience in designing and building ingestible devices for both humans and animals. I have worked on projects that involve the use of ingestible devices to monitor and improve health and behavior.

  bioelectronics:
    heading: Bioelectronics
    description: |
      I have experience in designing and building bioelectronic devices for both humans and animals. I have worked on projects that involve the use of bioelectronic devices to monitor and improve health and behavior.

  bci:
    heading: Brain-Computer Interfaces
    description: |
      Analysis and design go hand in hand. I have been experimenting with electrode design, placement within the ear, filters, and time frequency domain classifiers to improve signal-to-noise ratios and accuracy of classifying human attention in selection tasks.

  behavior:
    heading: Computational Behavior Analysis
    description: |
      Non-human species are non-verbal, active or passive participants with technology. Quantifying the relationship between animals and their world, such as how they bite, the frequency of play interactions, etc, provides us insight into more effectively improving animal welfare on farms and in the home environments.

  wearable:
    heading: Wearable Computing
    description: |
      I have been working on a project that uses a wearable device to monitor the health of working dogs. The device is a harness that has a variety of sensors to monitor the dog's health and behavior. The data is then sent to a handler's phone to alert them of any changes in the dog's health.
